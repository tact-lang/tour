    <p>
      Almost every contract operates on data: transforming some values into others.
      The scope may vary, but operators lie at the core of such modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most operators have augmented assignment versions, like <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, etc.,
      which form a statement, never an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no implicit type conversions in Tact, so operators canâ€™t be used to, say,
      add values of different types or compare them in terms of equality without explicitly
      casting them to the same type. That is done with certain functions from the standard library.
      The <code>Int.toString()</code> is an example of such a function.

        -four >> 2; // -1, because negation is applied first
        //             and >> performs arithmetic or sign-propagating right shift

        // Other common bitwise operators.
        five & four; // 4, due to bitwise AND
        five | four; // 5, due to bitwise OR

        five - 1 <= four; // true

        // Logical checks.
        !(five == 5); //       false, because of the inverse ! operator
        false && five == 5; // false, because && is short-circuited
        true || five != 5; //  true, because || is also short-circuited

        // The non-null assertion operator raises a compilation error if the value
        // is null or if the type of the value is not optional,
        // i.e., it can never be null.
