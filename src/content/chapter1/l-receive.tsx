    <p>
      On TON, contracts cannot read each other's states and cannot synchronously
      call each other's functions. Instead, the actor model of communication is
      applied â€” contracts send or receive asynchronous messages that influence each other's state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each message is a Cell with a well-defined, complex structure of serialization.
      However, Tact provides you with simple abstractions to send, receive, and
      (de)serialize messages to and from various structures.

      // TODO: message bodies
      // TODO: can be empty, no opcode, empty message body receiver or "empty receiver" for short.
      // TODO: receivers: All kinds and their order, on the left or on the right,
      //       see the inMsg() function
      // bounced messages, external messages, internal messages.
      // internal and external, where only first can bounce.
      // Or rather that external cannot revert/bounce, so the bounced are internal.
      // etc.

// in which case they won't have any opcode and could only be handled
// by the empty message body receiver or "empty receiver" for short.

// See the "Contracts and traits" section below for more info.

        // The actual processing and sending will be done in the next, action phase
        // of the transaction, where many messages can fail for various reasons.

        // For example, if the remaining value from the incoming message was used by
        // the first function, the subsequent functions that would try to do the same

        // and ignores the unprocessed messages. It's not a silver bullet, and you're

// To receive internal messages (bounced or sent directly) and external messages,
