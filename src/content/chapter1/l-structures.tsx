    <p>
      Structs and message structs allow multiple values to be packed together
      in a single type. They are very useful for (de)serialization of cells
      and for usage as parameters or return types in functions.
    </p>
    <CodeBlock
      code={tact`struct Pair { x: Int; y: Int }`}

    <p>
      Message structs are almost the same as regular structs,
      but they have a 32-bit integer header in their serialization.
      This unique numeric ID is commonly referred to as an opcode (operation code),
      and it allows message structs to be used with special receiver functions
      that distinguish incoming messages based on this ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, Tact generates and implicitly sets the 32-bit <code>Int</code> opcode.
      However, you can manually override it with any compile-time expression that
      evaluates to a non-negative 32-bit integer.
