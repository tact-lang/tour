    <p>
      <code>Int</code> is a 257-bit signed integer, which can have smaller bit-length in persistent contract's state (storage).
    </p>
    <p>
      Boolean or <code>Bool</code> values, true and false, are represented as integers on the blockchain
      with either a single 1 bit or a single 0 bit correspondingly. That said, Tact
      views booleans as a separate type <code>Bool</code>.
      They take only 1 bit when saved in persistent storage, but in runtime operations
      they are no different than the regular 257-bit signed integers.
