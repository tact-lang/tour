    <p>
      Tact is a statically typed language designed specifically for TON blockchain smart contracts. It provides safety, efficiency, and ease of use while maintaining the power needed for complex smart contract development.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tour covers most aspects of the Tact language, and assuming you have some prior programming experience should teach you enough to write real smart contracts in Tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tour is interactive! The code shown is editable and will be compiled and evaluated as you type. Anything you print using <code>dump()</code> will be shown in the bottom section, along with any compile errors and warnings.
