    <p>
      Tact is a statically typed language designed specifically for TON blockchain smart contracts. It provides safety, efficiency, and ease of use while maintaining the power needed for complex smart contract development.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tour covers most aspects of the Tact language, and assuming you have some prior programming experience should teach you enough to write real smart contracts in Tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tour is interactive! The code shown is editable and will be compiled and evaluated as you type. Anything you print using <code>dump()</code> will be shown in the bottom section, along with any compile errors and warnings.
    </p>
    {/* <CodeBlock
      code={ts`// WIP: This is here to test highlighting & friends
console.log(new Array(10).join(10 - "a") + " Batman!"); // a lot more text here to check the scroll`}
      lang="ts"
    />
    <CodeBlock
      code={tact`dump("Yay, Tact highlighting!");`}
    /> */}

      You can navigate through the tour using keyboard arrows ‚¨ÖÔ∏è and ‚û°Ô∏è to move between lessons or ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and ‚¨áÔ∏è  to open and close the list of contents. Additionally, you can simply click the relevant buttons below the content.

      To compile and deploy, press <code>Cmd+S</code> on macOS and <code>Ctrl+S</code> on other systems. Beware that the changes made to the code are lost in transitions!
